  "tool_description": "Dynamically translate between languages.\nThe Translation API provides a simple programmatic interface for translating an arbitrary string into any supported language using state-of-the-art Neural Machine Translation. It is highly responsive, so websites and applications can integrate with Translation API for fast, dynamic translation of source text from the source language to a target language (such as French to English). Language detection is also available in cases where the source language is unknown. The underlying technology is updated constantly to include improvements from Google research teams, which results in better translations and new languages and language pairs.",
