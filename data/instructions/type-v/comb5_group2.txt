Please generate 5 high-level instructions which can be solved with the combination of some of the APIs below. 

1. Compress image size at the cost of lower quality.
2. Changing the size (i.e. width and height) of image.
3. Convert the format of an image.
4. remove the background of an image.

For example:
Instruction: I have one image at files/object_detection/birds.jpg. I want to remove its background, and save it to png format.


==== RESPONSE ====
Here are 5 high-level instructions that involve the combination of the APIs listed:

Instruction 1:
"I have a set of product photos in a folder named 'inventory/photos'. I need to compress their sizes for faster loading on my e-commerce website, change their dimensions to fit the site's image placeholders, and convert them all to JPEG format."

Combination of APIs:
1. Use the compress image size API to reduce the quality of each photo for a smaller file size.
2. Utilize the change image size API to resize each image according to the website's requirements.
3. Apply the convert image format API to switch all images to the JPEG format.

Instruction 2:
"We need to prepare images for a presentation. Take the images from 'presentation/slides', remove the backgrounds to highlight the subjects, resize them to 800px by 600px, and save the edited images as PNG files to retain transparency."

Combination of APIs:
1. Apply the remove background API to each image to isolate the subjects.
2. Use the change image size API to adjust the resolution to 800px by 600px.
3. Implement the convert image format API to save the results in PNG format.

Instruction 3:
"For a mobile app, I need to batch process images in 'app_assets/icons'. First, I want to convert each image from PNG to SVG for scalability purposes, then remove the backgrounds, and finally resize the images to 100x100 pixels for icons."

Combination of APIs:
1. Call the convert image format API to change every image from PNG to SVG format.
2. Employ the remove background API for eliminating the backgrounds of these SVG images.
3. Use the change image size API to adjust each image's dimensions to 100x100 pixels for uniformity as icons.

Instruction 4:
"In our 'marketing/banners' folder, we have banner images that are too heavy for the web. Compress them to reduce file size by 50%, convert them to web-optimized JPEG format, and ensure each image is 1920px wide while maintaining the aspect ratio."

Combination of APIs:
1. Use the compress image size API to reduce file size by roughly 50%.
2. Utilize the convert image format API to switch the images to a web-optimized JPEG format.
3. Apply the change image size API to make the images 1920px in width, preserving their respective aspect ratios.

Instruction 5:
"The photos from 'events/conference' need editing before uploading to our gallery. We want to remove any distracting backgrounds, compress the file size for quicker web page load times, and standardize all images to a width of 1200px."

Combination of APIs:
1. Apply the remove background API to each photo to clean up distractions.
2. Utilize the compress image size API to make the files lighter and faster to load.
3. Use the change image size API to set the width of each cleaned photo to 1200px, maintaining the aspect ratio.
